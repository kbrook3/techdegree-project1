        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I’m an avid baker who is trying to learn the ropes at becoming a great Product Manager and laying the foundation for understanding code! I'm born &amp; raised in St. Louis but also have spent time living in Nasvhille, TN and have also spent time oversees in Vienna, Austria. I have a degree in classical piano and also have years of experience managing volunteer programs for large music festivals &#40;Lollapalooza and Austin City Limits to name a few!&#41;. Now I'm putting my skills to use at a successful young startup here in my own back yard.</p>
        <p>Aside from work, my husband and enjoy building our new home together, spending time with family &amp; friends and love cheering on the Cleveland Cavaliers. Go Cavs!</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I want to earn a better understanding of building web sites and learn the foundation of the following:</p>

          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>PHP</li>
        </ul>
