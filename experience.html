        <h2>Music Expereience</h2>
        <p>For the majority of my life, I have studied piano. At my time spent at a university, I earned a Bachelor of Arts with an Emphasis in Classical Piano, Minored in Communications and also received a Certificate in Music Entrepreneurship. I graduated with honors and spent a semester studying abroad in the music capital of the world, Vienna.</p>
        <p>Along with school, I spent 2 years performing in a local band. Along with 5 other musicians, I played keyboard, sang backup vocals and also played various percussion instruments.</p>

        <h2>Professional Experience</h2>
        <p>During my time in school, I held these various jobs:
        <ul>
          <li>University Tour Guide Manager</li>
          <li>Private Piano Instructor</li>
          <li>Part-Time Specialist at Apple</li>
          <li>Volunteer Recruiter for various festivals and events</li>
        </ul>  
        <p>All of these expereicnes have taught me how to best handle multiple projects at once, make quick decisions and that I can accomplish anything I put my mind to. Doing so has now led me to be the Executive Director of Client Operations at a growing startup and has led me to make impactful changes to my company.</p>
